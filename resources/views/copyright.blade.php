                    <p>It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In addition, we will promptly terminate the accounts of those determined by us to be "repeat infringers" without notice. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any content hosted on our web site (vidcloud.co) infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing VidCloud's Designated Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (please consult your legal counsel or See 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3) to confirm these requirements):</p>
                    <ul class="intext">
                        <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
                        <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on VidCloud are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that website.</li>
                        <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit VidCloud to locate the material. Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.</li>
                        <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit VidCloud to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</li>
